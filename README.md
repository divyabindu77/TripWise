TripWise is a smart travel planning web application that uses artificial intelligence to help users plan personalized trips based on their preferences. Built with Python and powered by Streamlit for the user interface, the app integrates LLM agents from the Phidata library to provide intelligent travel recommendations. It utilizes Groqâ€™s LLaMA language models for fast and coherent text generation and SerpAPI for real-time search, enabling the app to fetch up-to-date information about destinations, hotels, attractions, and more. With TripWise, users can simply enter their desired location and preferences, and the AI agent generates a customized travel itinerary. The app focuses on ease of use, dynamic interaction, and real-time intelligence, offering an intuitive way to plan trips smarter and faster.
